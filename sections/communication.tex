\section{Communication Tools (Sophie and Andy)}
Lines of communication need to flow among developers, among analyzers, and between developers and analyzers. Mu2e uses the following tools to communicate along all lines: email lists, Slack, doc-db, and GitHub.

Email lists are used to announce meetings. It is also used by developers to announce important hardware/software updates to analyzers that will affect their workflows.

Slack is used for quick-response day-to-day communication such as debugging active issues. It is also to communicate with users to help debug....

Doc-db is used to store meeting agendas, presentations, and reports.

Github is used to communicate between developers. Analyzers can post technical issues and feature requests. Developers review pull requests.

[Better to go through the tools one-by-one or by uses and mention the tools that are used?]
