\section{Offline Computing Model Overview (Dave+Bertrand)}
\label{sec:overview}

Brief history of computing efforts including TDR, CD3, SU2020, MDC2020

Brief overview of the offline computing model:

where does data appear from
Where does it go
What are the main processing stages
What are the principle algorithms used in the software trigger
What are the principle algorithms used in reconstruction
what are the main databases
what is the offline analysis model
what is the simulation plan
