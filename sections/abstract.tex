Mu2e is a discovery experiment that will search for charged lepton flavor violation, lepton number violation, and other evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model detectable through the decay of muons at rest.  Mu2eâ€™s signature measurement is a search for muon to electron conversion, a process that previous experiments have determined occurs fewer than approximately once every $10^{12}$ stopped muons.  Because Mu2e is a rare event search experiment, the emphasis of the Offline Computing Model is on supporting the precision analysis of modestly sized datasets.  In this document we present the overall architecture of that model, describe the development plan to achieve that model from the current status quo, and the plan to support the commissioning, operation, and the analysis of the first Mu2e data.  This document does not describe the online computing model for triggering and recording raw data.
