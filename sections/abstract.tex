Mu2e is a discovery experiment searching for charged lepton flavor violation, lepton number violation, and other evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model detectable through muon decays. The signature measurement is a search for muon-to-electron conversion, a process that previous experiments have determined occurs fewer than approximately once every $10^{12}$ stopped muons. In this document, we present the Mu2e offline computing model developed to store, process, simulate, and analyze the data collected by Mu2e. Since the experiment is designed to search for rare events, the focus is on supporting the precision analysis of modestly sized data sets. We describe the overall plan to realize the computing model and to support the commissioning, operation, and analysis of the first data. This document does not describe the online computing model for triggering and recording raw data.
