\section{Detector Calibration and Alignment (Richie)}
\label{sec:calibration}

Describe the data flow for calibration and alignment.
Describe the principle sources of calibration information (beam particles, cosmic rays, sources, random noise (CRV peds), ..
Describe the main algorithms and technologies used for calibration.
Give a detailed example of each, spread across sub-systems.
Describe the booststrap procedure to get from raw data to calibrated, including metrology and information from the cosmic ray commissioning run.
Describe simulated valiation of calibration procedures.
