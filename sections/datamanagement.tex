\section{Data management and Preservation}
\label{sec:datamngt}

Mu2e will follow the procedures for the management of experimental data
outlined in the Mu2e Data Management Plan\cite{Mu2e:DataManagementPlan}. 
This plan is reviewed every two years.

Raw data will be archived at Fermilab for several years after the end of the Mu2e data-taking phase. Two copies will be stored in physically separate locations. Over the lifetime of the experiment, many generations of derived datasets will be produced and Mu2e is developing a plan for life-cycle dataset management. Reduced datasets for analysis will have a much smaller size and those used for publication will also be retained for several years after the end of data taking. For all other datasets, generation N-2 will be deleted once generation N becomes inactive to free media space. This policy applies to both experimental and simulated data.

The Mu2e software is stored on GitHub and most repositories are publicly readable. As discussed in the Mu2e Software Policy~\cite{Mu2e:SoftwarePolicy}, repositories that hold proprietary analysis code are private until publication of the relevant paper. Once published, the repository is made publicly readable.

Prior to the data-taking phase, Mu2e will consult with CSAID to determine which support is best suited for making data publicly available, including support to preserve data at the end of the experiment.
