\section{Mu2e Experiment Organization}
\label{sec:mu2eorg}
Mu2e is organized into two major branches; Operations and Analysis.  Offline computing is a responsibility of Analysis, Online computing is part of Operations.  These overlap in the case of the software trigger, which is run by the Operations group, but whose algorithmic content is defined by the Analysis group.  The event processing framework (art), Conditions Data infrastructure, event display, and some data monitoring tools are shared between Online and Offline.   The formal transition from Online to Offline data processing has been agreed to occur when raw data art files appear on the FCS disk buffers (not sure about this location).

The Mu2e organization chart is shown in figure \ref{fig:orgchart}.  Under the Analysis branch, Offline computing is divided among several Core Groups responsible for specific tasks.  The basic organization into Operations and Analysis was adopted by the collaboration in Dec 2023.  The Core Groups were approved by the spokespersons in March 2024.  The current staffing of the Core Groups is preliminary, awaiting the introduction of deputies as collaborators complete their Project responsibilities.
